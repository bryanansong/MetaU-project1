### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I really found the topic on handling form inputs very useful as I had never worked with forms before

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would have loved to add a backend portion to the application in order to store the data

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The design of my project was really good. I loved collaborating with other people on the projects and I noticed that some of my friends went ahead to add some very custom features like a carousel, I would love to do that some day.
